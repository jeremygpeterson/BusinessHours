Create Business Hour object
	hours = BusinessHours.new("9:00 AM", "3:00 PM")

Updating Hours:
  Week Days are updated using Symbol and start/close hours as strings.
	hours.update :fri, "10:00 AM", "5:00 PM"
	hours.update :sat, "9:00 AM", "9:30 PM"

  Specific Days are updated using a Time or String Object and start/close hours as strings.
	hours.update "Dec 24, 2010", "8:00 AM", "1:00 PM"
	hours.update(Time.parse("6/11/2010"), "9:00", "10:00")

Closed Hours:
  Method specifying days closed, where symbols (week days) and Time or String Objects define specific days. 
	hours.closed :sun, :wed, "Dec 25, 2010"

  Checking Closed hours
	hours.closed? "Dec 25, 2010" => true

Iterating Business Hours:
  Iterates from Starting Date/Time for a maximum number of days.  Calls a block for each day with two arguments, the Time Object and a hash with open and close hours.  The Time object, returns each Time within open and close hours, unless closed.

	hours = BusinessHours.new("8:00 AM", "5:00 PM")
	hours.closed :sun
	hours.each("6/11/2010", 5) do |date, day_hours| 
		business_hours = (hours.closed?(date)) ? "Closed" : "#{day_hours[:open].strftime("%l:%M %p")} - #{day_hours[:close].strftime("%l:%M %p")}"
		puts "#{date.strftime("%x")}: #{business_hours}"
	end
